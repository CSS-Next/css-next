Attendees: Amit Sheen, Adam Argyle, Una Kravets, Mike Aparicio, Quentin Albert

* Amit - Grid in CSS3 - whole concept of CSS3 and CSS4 is that its outside of the versioning
    * Quentin - do people think grid is in CSS3
    * Una - CSS3 is specifically versioned with level 3 specs, a lot of history, grid is not a level 3 spec from CSS3 era, also many folks don’t use grid still and think of it as stable as other features in CSS3
    * Adam - people still think CSS3 is new, thats why its on resumes and people think grid is in it. Simultaneously module level 3 and colloquial level 3
    * Una - shouldn’t add features to bloat CSS3 bc its already defined and specific
    * Mike - working with  a lot of devs who don’t spend a ton of time on it, had CSS3 and that drove a lot of education but haven’t had much progress on that since
        * Haven’t really heard people call it CSS3 in several years
        * +1 need to establish a context of what is available in CSS today
        * People are struggling to keep up with it
        * Reminds of gaming consoles - what do you call the next thing
    * Amit - makes sense, but not we’ll have another thing to educate about (re-teach CSS3)
* [https://github.com/orgs/CSS-Next/projects/1/views/2](https://github.com/orgs/CSS-Next/projects/1/views/2)
    * Dedupe and convert into web app for the research
    * **Amit volunteered to build it**
    * Quentin - folks need to know what the feature is
        * Option for “don’t know this feature”
        * Can pull from state of css examples - 
            * Check wish Sasha if thats ok
* CSS4 - should this be taught in curriculums?
    * Quentin - with workshops - bracket things into “upcoming/future”
        * Should focus on CSS4 and tell people its especially CSS4
        * A lot of companies in Germany don’t want CSS workshops because they think CSS3 is the latest and it hasn’t evolved since then/needs to be re-taught
        * Big gap – here because I think this is the most important part to tell people about all this new stuff
            * Tried to teach a workshop on the new CSS and folks didnt even know basic things like aspect-ratio
* Despite card sort, we need to define CSS4 and that might change the definitions
    * Quentin - I would put cascade layers in CSS5 not CSS4
    * If we’re asking folks to rate features into CSS3,4,5 - we need to first define what each bucket is
        * Do we give an initial definition and refine it further later on
        * We should bring initial definition
    * Mike - maybe we don’t ask people what they think RE: CSS3 - i don’t recall when we came up with CSS3 those things weren’t all “production-ready” yet
        * CSS4 is all the cool stuff we can use today in browsers
        * CSS5 is horizon, can i use this or not?
    * Quentin - I would suggest we don’t ask if its css3, 4, or 5 but ask where they can use it on a timeframe (now, future) so its not related to CSS versions and more on perceive if its usable in production – decouple from this versioning system we haven’t figured out yet
    * Una - like the idea of timeline buckets instead of numbers,
        * CQ – is this ready for “now” – technically browser support is wide/baseline
    * Mike - need to draw a line which is separate from what are we teaching
    * Adam - still trying to figure out how this gets marketed
        * i'm not confident browser support at "some date" should impact this marketing effort to help educators and engineers articulate their status of CSS knowledge
        * How do we make it simple phrase that encapsulates all of these things
        * I think CSS4 is going to flop and confuse people, putting CSS4 on my resume not that impressive
        * Why was ES6 the last big JS version?
            * Una - possibly bc after that they went annual version, less impactful
        * How do we power educators to say they teach modern CSS?
    * Mike - can we take back “CSS” and just use CSS on resumes? People put CSS on their resumes but not know what a pseudo element is
        * I do internal talks and all of the CSS stuff I think people should be familiar with blows peoples minds
    * Una - i think “CSS” is the state we are now and folks aren’t keeping up. They don’t know the delta between what they know and don’t know (i.e 3 to 4)
    * Amit - I’m okay with CSS4 and 5, I feel like thats correct - and something people can understand
        * Absolutely agree about the gathering of elements into one name
    * Quentin - If we use “CSS” people who last learned CSS 10 years ago would be on the same page as folks who are using the latest today. Need a name we can iterare on for generations/levels/etc.
        * We dont want to bring out a new version every year - thats a big problem ecmascript has. People aren’t as interested. We should keep it on the level of every 5-6 years
* Question for the research survey:
    * 1. Show feature name and maybe an example (i.e. such as in state of css)
    * 2. Options for sorting:
        * A. I can use/have used this already
        * B. I could use this soon
        * C. It’s unclear when I could use this
        * D. I don’t know this feature
* Stable is a word with a lot of connotations
* When writing survey text, be sure to include in production
* Adam: how does this empower people by doing research?
    * If you learn this new term is aligns with this set of features
    * Why is having people bucket this helping them empower themselves
    * Una - we can just make a hard rule about dates - i.e. before 2017, after 2017 - but this also is tricky (i.e. houdini) for spec publish dates. Research gets us more opinions to help this wavy in-between or at least understand what people perceive
* Mike - what are the educational materials? 
    * Amit - people are still teaching tables
* Quentin - what do we do with features that have multiple subsets? I.e. container queries vs. style queries. Grid vs. subgrid
* Naming is hard - should probably be more precisely versioned and not vague
    * We need a new logo - it was catchy and stuck and outlived its intended thing
    * CSS4 as a sword (analogy to shield)
