Attendees: Una, ppk, Dominique Hazel-Massieux, Ian

Notes
- Need to coordinate with CSSWG bc only way to speak on anything CSS-related is through CSSWG
  - I.e. get their enthusiastic support on this
  - Conversation already started there through an issue
  - This is the first thing, after this everything will become really simple
- Did CSSWG appreciate CSS3 effort?
  - This was a mix of marketing and versioning
  - Some modules started as level 3 (since they came after level 2) are now level 1 bc they’re the first module of their type
  - Some recognize there was value in CSS3 branding which got lost when the working group focused on its versioning scheme
- What is the relationship of the snapshot between what you’re looking for?
  - Snapshot – fairly academic language
  - Focus on feature sets
  - Audience of the snapshot isn’t for the community
  - Discussed annual versioning but decided against it
  - Snapshots focus on specs, specs don’t always align with available features
  - Makes sense to go through the snapshots and take notes
  - Show that we’ve done our homework and looked at the snapshots to get past some early objections
  - We want to work w/CSSWG to select a set of features, emerging from the snapshots, focused on features, and label them as CSS4 / CSS5
  - Discuss snapshots as they’re great but not what the community needs
- Level 3 is confusing, naming question is open - worth packaging that to CSSWG
  - Numbering was a useful scheme to use but there might be other options to minimize risk
  - If you don’t use numbers people will get confused (i.e. iOS versioning systems, ie. Maverick vs. Ventura)
  - CSS-IV ???
  - Are existing naming discussions documented (yes, can share)
- Feedback back to the why
  - CSS3 was 12 years ago, this is the kind of momentous change we want to build up around so we think CSS4 will be this year and don’t expect CSS5 for X years
  - If you’re on a 5-year timescale, easier to keep up and much more worthy investment
  - If you can infuse a sense of pace, helps
  - Our idea right now was every few years (need to define)
  - Value in hinting at what’s coming up
- What are the next steps to scale this?
  - Practical problem in reaching out to people about CSS4 - need to get basic buy in from CSSWG first
  - Targetted outreach to folks in the space to get them involved? I.e. Eric Meyer
  - PPK also writing CSS book, such few books written in past few years
  - People are writing books on React and other frameworks still
- Important steps:
  - Charter (will help enable Apple to get involved, for example)
  - How do we get charter on the website for the CG?
  - Can link from the CG homepage to github (no formal process)
  - Once we have initial set of features, go to CSSWG
