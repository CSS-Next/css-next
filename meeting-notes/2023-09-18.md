Sep 18, 2023 | CSS4 Community Group BiWeekly
Attendees: PPK, Adam, Quentin, Amit

Resolved:
- Animation Composition, Cascade Layers, and Font Pallette Values to CSS5 -> done
- Color 4 gradients: 4 or 5? -> 5
- Containment: merge into Container Queries? -> no, but move it to 5
- Why is Grid in both 4 and 5? -> removed from 5; only 4
- Individual property transform -> 5
- :has(): 4 or 5? -> ? 5
- :is() and :where(): 4 or 5? -> ? 5

The final two points were hotly debated. Arguments for putting them in 4: they’re very fundamental. Argument for putting them in 5: they don’t have enough browser support yet. In the end we decided on 5.

Make sure that the survey asks about :has(), :is(), and :where() early on so that everybody will think about them. Let’s hope the survey gives a clear answer as to whether they should be in 4 or 5.

Next step: prepare for the survey
- Where to host? Amit offered his server. Or Netlify?
- How to market? Time to talk about CSS4 in public? Or spread the survey quietly?
- How to get the data out and summarise it? Data: only changes from our list?
